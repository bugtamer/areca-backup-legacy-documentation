> Open Source, easy to use and reliable backup solution for Linux and Windows.


## Areca Backup is an Open Source personal backup solution which is released under the General Public License ([GPL](https://opensource.org/licenses-old/gpl-license-html/)) v2.

It basically allows you to select a set of files / directories to back-up, choose where and how (as a simple file copy, as a zip archive, ...) they will be stored, and configure post-backup actions (like sending backup reports by email or launching custom shell scripts)


It has been designed to ...


_... Be as simple as possible to set up_ : No complex configuration files to edit - Your backup configuration (stored as an XML file) can be edited with Areca's graphical user interface.


_... Be as versatile as possible_ : Areca can use advanced backup modes (like "delta backup") or simply produce a basic copy of your source files as a standard directory or zip archive (readable by WinZip or other archivers).


_... Allow you to interact with your archives_ : Browse your archives, track and recover a specific version of a file, merge a set of archives into a single one, etc.
