## What is ArecaVSS

ArecaVSS is a plugin for the open source backup software Areca Backup ([www.areca-backup.org](../areca-backup.org/README.md)). It allows Areca-Backup to use Microsoft's Volume Shadow Copy service for backing up files that are locked by the system. (for instance outlook files)

## Compatibility

ArecaVSS requires Areca-Backup v7.2.13 or later and Windows Server 2003, 2008, Vista, 7 or later to operate properly. Due to specificities on the Volume Shadow Copy implementation for Windows XP, it won't operate on this system or earlier versions of Windows.


## Installation and usage

First, download ArecaVSS from [here](download.md) and unzip it in the "plugins" subdirectory of Areca-Backup. You should have a subdirectory named "arecavss".

Once done, get a free license of ArecaVSS [here](license.md) and copy it in the ArecaVSS directory. This license will be limited in time (2 days) but will allow you to test ArecaVSS on your computer without purchasing a full license.

Once you are totally sure that ArecaVSS works properly on your system, get a full license [here](license.md) and replace your free license by this new full license.


## Contact and support
