## Installation :

Once downloaded, unzip the file in the "plugins" subdirectory of Areca-Backup (something like "_C:\Program Files (x86)\Areca\plugins_" or "_C:\Program Files\Areca\plugins_" depending on your system and on where you installed Areca). You should have a subdirectory named "arecavss".

That's all ! Launch Areca-Backup and check that the plugin is properly detected in the "log" tab. You should have a "Volume Shadow Copy" tab in the target edition window.
